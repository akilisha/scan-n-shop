```

### Environment Variables Explained

## Webhook Handling

### Webhook Endpoint

```
POST /api/payments/webhooks/stripe
```

### Supported Events

- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Payment completed successfully
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Payment failed
- `account.updated` - Connect account status changed
- `account.application.deauthorized` - Account disconnected
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Subscription payment succeeded
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Subscription payment failed
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription canceled

### Webhook Security

Webhooks are secured using Stripe's signature verification:

```javascript
const sig = req.headers["stripe-signature"];
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  req.body,
  sig,
  process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
);
```

## Referral System Details

### How It Works

1. **Code Generation**: Each user gets a unique referral code (e.g., `KERB12AB34CD`)
2. **Sharing**: Users share codes via link or social media
3. **Sign-up**: New users enter code during registration
4. **Validation**: System validates code and creates referral record
5. **Rewards**: Both referrer and referee receive benefits

### Benefits Structure

#### For Sellers (Referrers)

- 1 month of seller fees waived per successful referral
- Cumulative credits that can be applied to future billing
- Real-time tracking of referral status and earnings

#### For New Users (Referees)

- First month free on any seller plan
- Access to premium features during trial period
- Welcome bonus credits for initial transactions

### Referral Code Format

```
KERB + [8 chars from User ID] + [4 chars timestamp]
Example: KERB12AB34CD
```

### Validation Rules

- Codes expire after 1 year
- Users cannot refer themselves
- Maximum 50 referrals per user per year
- Only successful sign-ups with verified payment methods count

## Marketplace Fee Structure

### Application Fees

- **Percentage Fee**: 2.9% of transaction amount
- **Fixed Fee**: 30¬¢ per transaction
- **Maximum Fee**: Cannot exceed transaction amount

### Fee Calculation Example

```javascript
const calculateApplicationFee = (amount) => {
  const percentageFee = Math.round(amount * 0.029);
  const totalFee = percentageFee + 30; // 30 cents fixed fee
  return Math.min(totalFee, amount);
};

// For a $100 transaction:
// Percentage fee: $100 √ó 2.9% = $2.90
// Fixed fee: $0.30
// Total fee: $3.20
```

### Payout Schedule

- **Express Accounts**: Daily automatic payouts
- **Standard Accounts**: Configurable (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Minimum Payout**: $1.00
- **Currency**: USD (expandable to other currencies)

## Testing

### Test Cards

#### Successful Payments

#### Error Scenarios

- `4000000000000002` - Card declined

- `4000000000009987` - Lost card
- `4000000000009979` - Stolen card

### Test Connect Accounts

Stripe provides test Connect accounts for development:

- All test data is automatically cleared
- No real money transactions
- Full API functionality available

### Development Mode

The app includes stub components for development:

- `StripePaymentFormStub` - Mock payment form
